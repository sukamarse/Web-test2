View live webpage [here](https://annacate.github.io/google-homepage/).

## Motivation
This webpage was created as the final project in "The Front End" sub-section of the "Web Development 101" section of The Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101). The purpose of the project was to practice writing and editing basic HTML and CSS, as well as to practice using Git and the Google Chrome developer tools.

## Technology used
HTML and CSS

## Features
This webpage mimics the appearance of the true Google Homepage, including many of the CSS hover styles.

## Limitations
None of the buttons are functional, there is no favicon, and I was not yet able to figure out how to insert the microphone icon into the search box.

## Upgrades for the future
To improve the clone, I would need to add a favicon as well as the microphone icon in the search box. I would also need to add a hover event to the "I'm Feeling Lucky" search button.
